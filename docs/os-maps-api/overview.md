This guide explains how to create an account and get an API key on the OS Data Hub.

Get started for free and integrate Ordnance Surveyâ€™s up-to-date, detailed maps in your apps, enabling your customers to make location-based decisions with confidence, removing the overhead of managing complex datasets yourself.

Choose the style that suites your use case best, whether you need the detail of OS MasterMap or our iconic Leisure maps. There are four styles available: Road, Outdoor, Light and Leisure. Each map style contains OS OpenData and Premium data layers.

OS Maps API serves pre-rendered raster tiles and is available in two projections; British National Grid for GB data and Web Mercator which is a global coordinate system. You can request the maps using the Open Geospatial Consortium Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) standard or RESTful ZXY. WMTS is supported by most GIS software and ZXY is efficient for web mapping.
