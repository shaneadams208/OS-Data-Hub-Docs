## 2D model

A surface such as a plane or the surface of a sphere has a dimension of two \(2D\) because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it – for example, both a latitude \(y-coordinate\) and longitude \(x-coordinate\) are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere.

In addition to describing things that are positioned relative to the Earth \(also see geospatial data\), spatial data may also describe things using other coordinate systems that are not related to position on the Earth, such as the size, shape and positions of cellular and sub-cellular Spatial Things described using the 2D or 3D Cartesian coordinate system of a specific tissue sample.

## Spatial object

Means an abstract representation of a real-world phenomenon related to a specific location or geographical area.

## Spatial operator

Function or procedure that has at least one spatial parameter in its domain or range.

## Spatial reference system \(SRS\)

A spatial reference system \(SRS\) is a coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical entities. A spatial reference system defines a specific map projection, as well as transformations between different spatial reference systems.

## Spatial relationship

Specifies how a Spatial Thing is located in space in relation to another Spatial Thing. Typically determined using a spatial operator.

## Spatial thing

Anything with spatial extent, \(i.e. size, shape, or position\) and is a combination of the real-world phenomenon and its abstraction \(the feature\). Examples are: people, places, or bowling balls.

## Spatiotemporal

Representing a set of direct positions in space and time.

## Spherical coordinate system

Three-dimensional coordinate system with one distance measured from the origin and two angular coordinates, commonly associated with a geodetic coordinate reference system.

## Temporal reference system

Reference system against which time is measured.

## Temporal thing

Anything with temporal extent, i.e. duration. e.g. the taking of a photograph, a scheduled meeting, a GPS time-stamped track-point.

## Thematic map

A map showing, by color or pattern, the distribution of a single phenomenon.

## Topographic map

A map whose principal purpose is to portray the features of the earth\`s surface. These features might include the cultural landscape, but normally refer to the terrain and its relief.

## Topography

The study of the physical features of the Earth. A topographic map’s principal purpose is to portray and identify the features of the Earth.

## Topology

The logical relationships between interacting points, lines, and polygons that are independent of spatial values. For example, two adjacent touching polygons may be topologically independent geometries, or they may be toplogically linked by the sharing of an edge. This can enforce a skin-of-the-earth model in that if one of those polygons changes the shared edge, then the other polygon will match the change, so as to avoid overlaps or slivers.

## Triangulated irregular network \(TIN\)

This is a vector data structure that represents a surface in three dimensions. Masspoints \(or z-values\) are joined up as irregular triangles to form a surface to provide a more accurate and less dense method of representing a Digital Terrain Model. This is because the edges of features are preserved and masspoints are only depicted where necessary to depict changes in slope.

## True north

True north \(also called geodetic north\) is the direction along Earth's surface towards the geographic North Pole or True North Pole.

## Term \(Acronym\)

Definition

## Unique object identifier

Identifier associated with a spatial object \[DS-D2.5\].

## Unique Property Reference Number \(UPRN\)

A unique numeric identifier for every spatial address in Great Britain. It provides a comprehensive, complete, consistent identifier throughout a property's life cycle – from planning permission through to demolition.

## Unique Resource Identifier \(URI\)

Uniform Resource Identifier - A Uniform Resource Identifier \(URI\) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.

## United Kingdom Hydrographic Office \(UKHO\)

The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office is the UK's agency for providing hydrographic and marine geospatial data to mariners and maritime organisations across the world.

## Unregistered land

Unregistered land in England and Wales to which title is not yet registered. Unregistered land in Scotland and Northern Ireland is governed by the separate registries of Land Register of Scotland and Land Registers of Northern Ireland.

## Unstructured data

Any document, file, graphic, image, text, report, form, video, or sound recording that has not been tagged or otherwise structured into rows and columns or records. This term has some inaccurate connotations, as there is usually some structure \(for instance, paragraphs and chapters\) in these formats.

## Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system \(UTM\)

A planar locational reference system which provides positional descriptions accurate to 1 meter in 2,500 across the entire earth\`s surface except the poles. Based on the Universal Transverse Mercator map projection. At the poles, the Universal Polar Stereographic projection is used. The UTM system divides the earth\`s surface into a grid in which each cell, excluding overlap with its neighbors, is 6 degrees east to west, and 8 degrees north to south \(with the exception of the row from 72-84 degrees north latitude\). For any position in the UTM grid, X-Y coordinates can be determined in eastings and northings. Eastings are in meters with respect to a central meridian drawn through the center of each grid zone \(and given an arbitrary easting of 500,000 meters\). In the northern hemisphere, northings are read in meters from the equator \(0 meters\). In the southern hemisphere, the equator is given the false northing of 10 million meters.

## Valuation Office Agency \(VOA\)

The Valuation Office Agency \(VOA\) gives the government the valuations and property advice needed to support taxation and benefits. VOA is an executive agency, sponsored by HM Revenue & Customs.

## Vector

A representation of the spatial extent of geographic features using geometric elements \(such as point, curve, and surface\) in a coordinate space.

## Vertical coordinate reference system

One-dimensional coordinate reference system based on a vertical datum.

## Vertical coordinate system

One-dimensional coordinate system used for gravity-related height or depth measurements.

## Vertical datum

Datum describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths to the Earth.
