Added information to the ...

This demo site simply is meant to showcase what is possible using a static site generator. We used [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) for this demo.

**Benefits:**
- Documentation is built directly from a [Github repository](https://github.com/johnx25bd/os-data-hub-documentation). 
  - Here, Github acts as a Content Management System. 
  - History is automatically captured. 
  - Anyone can edit or suggest changes - including from mobile.
  - If configured properly, updates can be deployed instantly upon approval.  
- Documentation is written and stored in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), readable by both humans and machines. 
- Sophisticated interactivity can easily be built into pages using React and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). 
- Site-wide styling and customization is easy using component-driven development.
- This demo was put together in about 5 hours - and the developer had never used Docusaurus. 
- Strong search functionality available via [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) once documentation is complete.
- See the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) docs as a great example.

A simple demo - here is a Leaflet map embedded rendering raster tiles from the OS Maps API:

import {MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup} from "react-leaflet";

  <MapContainer center={[51.505, -0.09]} zoom={13} >
    <TileLayer
      attribution='&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
      url="https://api.os.uk/maps/raster/v1/zxy/Outdoor_3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?key=JydUr1HO7ejqBhw0YP19W3b1GonFwmzr"
    />
    <Marker position={[51.505, -0.09]}>
      <Popup>
        A pretty CSS3 popup. <br /> Easily customizable.
      </Popup>
    </Marker>
  </MapContainer>




:::note

This is purely a demo site - content is **not** accurate. Also, it won't work on Internet Explorer 11. You'll notice lots of design quirks because this has not be thoroughly designed - that comes next.

:::

If you'd like to clone this repo, run it on your local machine, and develop new features - you can! You'll need [NodeJS installed](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-install-and-use-node-js-and-npm-mac-and-windows/).

In Terminal on Mac:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:johnx25bd/os-data-hub-documentation.git
cd os-data-hub-documentation
npm install
npm run start
```

And that's it! You should have the site running on `http://localhost:3000/`

Below you can find info on how Markdown works. Explore the right-hand menu. We can also implement a blog, restructure the site however we want, etc etc. Btw, this demo site is being hosted on [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) - which is built on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) ðŸ˜Ž

## OS Data Hub Documentation

### Examples

Do you want to search for greenspaces within 1km of your location or display 3D buildings on your map? Would you like to display a custom map style or a beautiful OS Explorer map in your application?

These copy-and-paste code examples are a great place to start. They showcase the functionality within each API and could be the building blocks to your own application.

Available in various mapping libraries, you can view a live example before trying it out yourself. Get a better understanding of the functionality and see what is possible.

Copy the code examples and use as they are or customise to make them your own.

[View Examples](https://labs.os.uk/public/os-data-hub-examples/)

Demos

This is a good place to start if you want to understand more about the APIs and how you can start to integrate them into a web application.

In this GitHub repository you will find code samples that demonstrate OS Maps API, OS Features API and OS Vector Tile API. Each product has its own demo and there is one showing airports that combines functionality to demonstrate how they can be used together.

They all use plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Markdown Syntax

You can write content using [GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

To serve as an example page when styling markdown based Docusaurus sites.

1. First ordered list item
1. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
1. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks

- Or minuses

+ Or pluses

## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com/)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com/ "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. http://www.example.com/ or <http://www.example.com/> and sometimes example.com (but not on GitHub, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/
[1]: http://slashdot.org/
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com/

## Images

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style: ![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png 'Logo Title Text 1')

Reference-style: ![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png 'Logo Title Text 2'

Images from any folder can be used by providing path to file. Path should be relative to markdown file.

![img](../../static/img/logo.svg)

## Code

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print(s)
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```js {2}
function highlightMe() {
  console.log('This line can be highlighted!');
}
```

## Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

---

## Inline HTML

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

---

## Line Breaks

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
